     <p>Letra: <br> 
         <pre>
Yeah, bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red

Bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red

Mmm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle

Mmm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle (yeah, yeah)

Said my happiness is all of your misery
I put good dick all in my kidneys
This Margiel' don't come with no jealousy
My illness don't come with no remedy
I am so much fun without Hennessy
They just want my love and my energy
You can't talk no shit without penalties
Bitch, I'm in yo' shit if you send for me
I'm going to glow up one more time
Trust me, I have magical foresight
You gon' see me sleepin' in courtside
You gon' see me eatin' ten more times
Ugh, you can't take that bitch nowhere
Ugh, I look better with no hair
Ugh, ain't no sign I can't smoke here
Ugh, gimme the chance and I'll go there (yeah)

Yeah, bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red

Bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red

Mmm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle

Mmm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle (yeah, yeah)

Said pop make money, now you try, bitch
You could use a revamp with a new vibe, sis
I don't need a big feature or a new sidekick
I don't need a new fan, 'cause my boo like it
I don't need to wear a wig to make you like it
I'm a two-time bitch, you ain't knew I'd win?
Throw a shot like you tryna have a food fight then
All my opps waitin' for me to be you, I bet

Said I got drive, I don't need a car
Money really all that we fiendin' for
I'm doin' things they ain't seen before
Fans ain't dumb, but extremists are
I'm a demon, Lord
Fall off what? I ain't seen the horse
Called your bluff, better cite the source
Fame ain't somethin' that I need no more

'Cause, bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red

Bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red

Mmm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle

Mmm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle
